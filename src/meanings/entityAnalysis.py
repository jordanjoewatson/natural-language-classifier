Motorbikes are kind of cool, also pizza, Pizza from Italy would be nice to try. Also Ford cars are kind of cool. What about Hurricane Catrina, Katrina? Who cares... Or the first world War or the Holocaust. I really like Beethoven and the song All You Need Is Love. Troublemaker, trying to think of famous pieces now, the Mona Lisa, Fur Elise. Law something about law... The Equality Act of 1990 I think who gives a fuck. Norwegian is an awesome language, just like Kanji is awesome too. What about Norge? does that work? The 19th Century was cool, or the Baroque Period. I really like watching minutes go by, 1 minute, two minute, three seconds four. 100 Percent of nothing is 100% of nothing.
